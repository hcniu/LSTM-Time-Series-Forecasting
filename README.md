# LSTM-Time-Series-Forecasting
In this project, I created a LSTM forecasting model to accurately forecast future sales. To me, this project is a great opportunity to actually practice my knowledge about RNN and LSTM in real time cases. In this project, I use random search to tune my two layers LSTM model. In the jupyter notebook, I carefully recorded every single step of creating the model from scratch. If there's any idea you want to share with me about this project, feel free to contact me via Linkedin.
